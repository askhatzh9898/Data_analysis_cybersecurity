# Sample domain blacklist for testing
# Format: one domain per line, comments start with #
# Subdomains automatically match (evil.com matches *.evil.com)
#
# In production, populate from feeds like:
# - URLhaus
# - PhishTank
# - OpenPhish
# - Your SIEM/SOAR findings

# DGA-like domains from sample data (fictional)
asdkjqwe.xyz    # Matches sample dns.log - simulated DGA
xvnmqpfl.xyz    # Matches sample dns.log - simulated DGA
qwplmzxr.xyz    # Matches sample dns.log - simulated DGA

# Example: blocking a parent domain catches all subdomains
# evil-corp.com           # Blocks *.evil-corp.com too
# malware-download.net    # From incident INC-2024-002
